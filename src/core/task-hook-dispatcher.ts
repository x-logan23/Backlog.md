/**
 * Owns the previous-status snapshot for every task and decides when to fire
 * the onStatusChange hook. This is the single point of hook firing — both
 * `Core.updateTaskFromInput` and the file watcher route through here, so the
 * suppression contract in {@link TaskWriteCoordinator} guarantees no
 * double-fires regardless of code path.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *  1. The owner constructs the dispatcher and calls {@link TaskHookDispatcher.seedSnapshot}
 *     once with the initial set of tasks (typically from the ContentStore's
 *     first load). This populates the previous-status map without firing any
 *     hooks — initial state is not a transition.
 *  2. On every subsequent task write that the watcher observes, the watcher
 *     calls {@link TaskHookDispatcher.onTaskWrite}. The dispatcher compares
 *     the new status against its snapshot, updates the snapshot, and fires
 *     the hook iff (a) the status genuinely transitioned, AND (b) the
 *     coordinator reports the write was NOT in-process. In-process writes
 *     already fired the hook through `Core.updateTaskFromInput` via the
 *     direct dispatch path.
 *  3. On deletion, the owner calls {@link TaskHookDispatcher.forgetTask} so a
 *     subsequent re-creation with the same id is treated as a new task, not
 *     a transition from the long-dead previous status.
