# Advanced Configuration

For getting started and the interactive wizard overview, see [README.md](README.md#-configuration).

## Configuration Commands

| Action      | Example                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| View all configs | `backlog config list` |
| Get specific config | `backlog config get defaultEditor` |
| Set config value | `backlog config set defaultEditor "code --wait"` |
| Enable auto-commit | `backlog config set autoCommit true` |
| Bypass git hooks | `backlog config set bypassGitHooks true` |
| Enable cross-branch check | `backlog config set checkActiveBranches true` |
| Set active branch days | `backlog config set activeBranchDays 30` |

Running `backlog config` with no arguments launches the interactive advanced wizard, including guided Definition of Done defaults editing (add/remove/reorder/clear).

## Detailed Notes

> Editor setup guide: See [Configuring VIM and Neovim as Default Editor](backlog/docs/doc-002%20-%20Configuring-VIM-and-Neovim-as-Default-Editor.md) for configuration tips and troubleshooting interactive editors.

> **Note**: Set `remoteOperations: false` to work offline. This disables git fetch operations and loads tasks from local branches only, useful when working without network connectivity.

> **Git Control**: By default, `autoCommit` is set to `false`, giving you full control over your git history. Task operations will modify files but won't automatically commit changes. Set `autoCommit: true` if you prefer automatic commits for each task operation.

> **Git Hooks**: If you have pre-commit hooks (like conventional commits or linters) that interfere with backlog.md's automated commits, set `bypassGitHooks: true` to skip them using the `--no-verify` flag.

> **Performance**: Cross-branch checking ensures accurate task tracking across all active branches but may impact performance on large repositories. You can disable it by setting `checkActiveBranches: false` for maximum speed, or adjust `activeBranchDays` to control how far back to look for branch activity (lower values = better performance).

> **Status Change Callbacks**: Set `onStatusChange` to run a shell command whenever a task's status changes. Available variables: `$TASK_ID`, `$OLD_STATUS`, `$NEW_STATUS`, `$TASK_TITLE`. Per-task override via `onStatusChange` in task frontmatter. Example: `'if [ "$NEW_STATUS" = "In Progress" ]; then claude "Task $TASK_ID ($TASK_TITLE) has been assigned to you. Please implement it." & fi'`

> **Shell selection (cross-platform)**: The optional `shell` config picks the interpreter used to run `onStatusChange`. Default `auto` uses `sh` on POSIX and prefers `sh.exe` on Windows (falling back to `cmd.exe` with a warning if Git for Windows isn't installed). Override with `sh`, `bash`, `cmd`, `pwsh`, `powershell`, or an absolute path to any interpreter (treated as POSIX-style `-c`). Note: variables are always passed as environment variables, so on `cmd` use `%TASK_ID%` and on PowerShell use `$env:TASK_ID` instead of `$TASK_ID`.

> **Date/Time Support**: Backlog.md now supports datetime precision for all dates. New items automatically include time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format in UTC), while existing date-only entries remain unchanged for backward compatibility. Use the migration script `bun src/scripts/migrate-dates.ts` to optionally add time to existing items.

## Theming the web UI

The browser interface ships with one look, and `theme` replaces its colors without touching any component or rebuilding anything.

```bash
backlog config set theme bankaya     # loads backlog/themes/bankaya.css
backlog config set theme ""          # back to the default look
```

Every Tailwind utility in the UI compiles to a CSS custom property — `.bg-gray-50` is `background-color: var(--color-gray-50)` — and the whole palette is declared on `:root`. A theme is therefore just a stylesheet that redefines the variables it cares about; everything referencing them re-colors at once.

Create `backlog/themes/<name>.css`:

```css
/* backlog/themes/bankaya.css */
:root {
  /* Brand primary. Used by buttons, links, focus rings and the active nav item. */
  --color-blue-600: #0a3d62;
  --color-blue-700: #082f4b;

  /* Page and surface neutrals. */
  --color-gray-50: #f7f9fb;
  --color-gray-100: #eef2f6;
}

/* Dark mode is a separate per-viewer toggle; target it with .dark. */
.dark {
  --color-gray-800: #101820;
  --color-gray-900: #0a1014;
}
```

Notes:

- **The file is read per request**, so editing a palette only needs a page reload — no `bun run build`, no server restart.
- **Only the variables you set change.** Anything you leave out keeps its default, so a theme can be three lines or three hundred.
- **`theme` unset is the default look** — no stylesheet is fetched beyond an empty response, and the UI renders exactly as it always has.
- **Light and dark are orthogonal.** The theme is project-wide config; light/dark stays a per-viewer choice in the UI. Put shared values on `:root` and mode-specific ones under `.dark`.
- **Names are filenames, not paths.** Letters, digits, dot, dash and underscore only; a name that could point outside `themes/` is ignored and the default look is used.
- **Keep the theme file unlayered.** Tailwind emits its own output inside cascade layers, and unlayered CSS beats layered CSS regardless of load order — which is exactly what lets a theme win. Wrapping your rules in `@layer` would hand precedence back to the defaults and silently do nothing.
- **A missing or broken theme never breaks the board** — it falls back to the default and logs a warning on the server.

To find the variable behind a color, inspect the element in your browser: the computed style shows the `var(--color-…)` the utility resolves to.
